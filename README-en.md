# Holodule iCalendar

[\[日本語\]](README.md) [English]

Holodule iCalendar is a program that generates and distributes iCalendar
files (with the extension `.ics`) from
[Holodule](https://schedule.hololive.tv/) (the streaming schedule for
Hololive).  This file format can be registered with many calendar
applications.

## Caverts

### Calendar update frequency

The update frequency is set to once per hour (it seems Holodule itself
updates every 15 minutes).

The frequency at which the calendar app updates might affect how quickly
changes appear in your calendar.  In iOS, you can adjust the update
frequency in the settings.

### I want notifications

Some calendars allow you to set notifications.  Please also consider using
YouTube's notification feature.

### Stream length

The duration of all streams is fixed at **2 hours**.  This is because only
the scheduled start times of the streams are available from Holodule.
